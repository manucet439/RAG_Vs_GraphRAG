# RAG_Vs_GraphRAG
A comprehensive comparison of Graph RAG and traditional vector-based RAG systems using synthetic corporate data. This repository contains modular implementations of both approaches, demonstrating how knowledge graphs can improve relationship-based query performance.
It includes code for chunking documents, storing them in both vector and graph databases, and retrieving answers
## Development Note
This project was primarily developed using AI assistance (Claude and GPT-4) to accelerate the implementation and comparison of Graph RAG vs Traditional RAG systems. The code serves as a research prototype for evaluating these approaches.
